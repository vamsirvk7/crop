smart crop protection system is used to protect the crops by using various sensors(iot)

A smart crop protection system using IoT (Internet of Things) can revolutionize agriculture by providing real-time monitoring and automated responses to various environmental factors and threats.

The NodeMCU, based on the ESP8266, is a popular and cost-effective IoT development board that can handle various tasks in the smart crop protection system. we can use it to connect and manage multiple sensors, collect data, and communicate with other devices or the cloud.

various sensors are used those are :
Soil Moisture Sensors: Depending on the soil type and distribution, you might need several soil moisture sensors distributed evenly across the field to monitor moisture levels at different points.

Rain Sensors: One or more rain sensors placed at various locations to detect precipitation accurately.

DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensors: These sensors can provide valuable data on temperature and humidity levels within the crop canopy. You may need several of these sensors dispersed throughout the field to capture variations.

PIR Sensor : A Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor is a type of motion sensor that detects infrared radiation emitted by objects in its field of view.

ESP32 Cam: These cameras can be strategically positioned to provide visual monitoring of the crop health and detect any anomalies like pest infestations or diseases. The number of cameras needed depends on the size and layout of the field.

Relays: Relays are used to control various actuators such as irrigation systems, fans, or alarms based on the data collected from the sensors. The number of relays required depends on the number of actuators and control points in your system.
